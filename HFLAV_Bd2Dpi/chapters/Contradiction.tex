\section{Contradiction}

When trying to calculate the transformations between the different notations in this field we expected that both presented
approaches in \cref{sec:decrateeq} and \cref{sec:coef} would lead to the same result. For \babar this expectation is nicely
fulfilled and gives confidence that the deduced transformations are correct. In contradiction to this we observed that for
the \CP parameters $S_{i}$ the transformation from the \belle notation into the HFLAV convention gave opposite signs for
both approaches, while for both appraches showed the same transformation rule for the $C_i$ parameters, which we did as a
crosscheck (see a summary of the derived transformation rules in \cref{tab:trans_sum}).
